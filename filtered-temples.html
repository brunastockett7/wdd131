      <h2>Welcome to the Temple Experience</h2>
      <p>Temples are more than architectural masterpieces—they are the holiest places on earth where Heaven touches the hearts of God’s children. In temples, sacred ordinances are performed that bind families together for eternity and provide guidance, strength, and comfort in a world filled with uncertainty. Every detail of a temple, from its design to its purpose, points us toward Jesus Christ and His role as our Savior. Inside, we are taught eternal truths, make covenants with God, and find refuge from life’s storms.</p>
      <p>President Russell M. Nelson declared, “The temple lies at the center of strengthening our faith and spiritual fortitude because the Savior and His doctrine are the very heart of the temple.” As we prepare and enter the temple, we receive clarity, peace, and purpose. The ordinances performed there are not only for ourselves but also on behalf of those who have passed on. He added, “Spending time in the temple in holy service and sacred ceremonies will help us to think celestial and will bring us the peace and revelation we seek.”</p>
